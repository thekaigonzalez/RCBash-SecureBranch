                                                 RCBash for KTerminal Developers

                                    RCBash is a high-level command processor written in Python, made
                                    for safety, and reliability.

                                    This version of RCBash contains security features, and bug fixes.

                                    It also contains some ports of KTerminal commands, like xxd, cat, and
                                    rd.

                                    When using RCBash, you can use "set" to add variables.

                                    like
                                        `

                                            set hello "world"
                                        
                                        `
                                    Then you can print variables or run them.

                                    $ hello
                                    no such command: world
                                    $ printf `$hello`
                                    world $

                                    you can also print secure warnings using "printf `$secure_warnings \n`"
